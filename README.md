# Nano-Golf
By: Sam B. and Ayan C.

Our Physics C final project

This is a game in which you play mini-golf, but with electrons. You can "shoot" an electron by clicking and dragging your mouse, giving the electron some initial velocity. Bounce off of walls, curve along magnetic fields, and push against the electric forces other electrons create as you shoot your way into the goal, and through each of our 8 levels. Try to see the best score you can get!

Technical description:

We coded the entirety of the game in python, using pygame for the graphical component, and using pyinstaller to export it as an executable. 
We generate our levels through the use of image files, with specific color values representing different tiles within our game, making it easy to create levels. 
Within our code we simulate real world physics, making our electrons and various fields and forces relatively "realistic". 

Here is a complete demo of our game:
